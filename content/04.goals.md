# 5. Goals

The herein proposed baseline harnesses the capabilities of the quality factors
in the underlying software to lay out the principles for attaining quality in
the enabled services within the EOSC context. According to this view, service
quality is the foundation to shape user-centric, reliable and fit-for-purpose
services. 

The Service Quality baseline aims at fulfilling the following goals:

1. Complement with a DevOps approach the existing approaches to assess and
   assure the quality and maturity of services within the EOSC, i.e. Technology
   Readiness Levels (TRLs) and EOSC Service Management System (SMS).

2. Build trust on the users by strengthening the reliability and stability of
   the services, with a focus on the underlying software, thus ensuring a proper
   realization of the verification and validation processes.

3. Ensure the functional suitability of the service by promoting testing
   techniques that check the compliance with the user requirements.

4. Improve the usability by identifying the set of criteria that fosters the service adoption.

5. Promote the automated validation of the service quality criteria.
