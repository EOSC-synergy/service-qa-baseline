# A1. Annex {.page_break_before}

The Quality Criteria described in this document follows a technology-agnostic approach, as such the
choice of tools and services to implement the code workflow, followed by the verification &
validation processes, is up to the team or community developing or operating a given service.

This annex describes an implementation approach to help service developers and operators, cover the
Quality Criteria detailed in this document.

## A1.1. Code workflow

## A1.2. Services

As it can be seen in Figure 1, multiple services take part in the execution of the CI/CD pipelines.
Table 1 shows the list of services used for the service Verification and Validation of the Quality
Criteria detailed in this document.

Ansible and Ansible-Galaxy are used be many services as deployment and configuration tool.

Table 1: Tools and services used to implement the Service QA criteria, also shown the criteria where
applicable.

## A1.3. Tools for CI/CD

This section shows the tools being used in the CI pipelines and the criteria that it verifies. This
list is based on the template file in
<https://github.com/EOSC-synergy/sqa-composer-templates/blob/main/tooling.json>.

| Tool       | Criteria      | Language   | Repo URL or documentation                             | Summary                  |
