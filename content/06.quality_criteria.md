## Quality Criteria

The following sections describe the quality conventions and best
practices that apply to the development, operation and integration
phases of a **Service** with a production infrastructure for research,
such as the EOSC ecosystem. These guidelines rule the **Service** development
and operation process within the framework of the EOSC-Synergy project.

Some of the criteria in this document is similar or based on the
document "Software Quality Assurance baseline"
[@url:https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/160086], for such cases the
following tag is added to the criteria: [SQA-QC.XyNN] where QC.XyNN is
the codename of the criteria in that document.

### Integration Testing [SvcQC.Int]

Integration testing refers to the evaluation of the interactions among
coupled **Service** or parts of a system that cooperate to achieve a given
functionality.

* **[SvcQC.Int01]** Integration testing outcome MUST guarantee the overall
operation of the  **Service** whenever new functionality is involved. [SQA-QC.Int01].

* **[SvcQC.Int02]** Integration testing SHOULD be automated.

* **[SvcQC.Int03]** Ad-hoc pilot **Service** infrastructures and/or local
testbeds MAY be used to cope with the integration testing requirements. [SQA-QC.Int04].

### Scalability tests [SvcQC.Sca]

Scalability Testing is a non-functional test methodology in which an
applicationâ€™s performance is measured in terms of its ability to scale
up or scale down the number of user requests or other such performance
measure attributes [@url:https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/what-is-scalability-testing/].

* **[SvcQC.Sca01]**

### Elasticity tests [SvcQC.Ela]

Elasticity is the level of autonomous adaptation provided by the
cloud layer in response to variable demand for the software
service [@doi:10.1186/s13677-019-0134-y].

* **[SvcQC.Ela01]**

### Acceptance and System tests [SvcQC.Acc]

Test of functionality of the **Service**, tests done before the **Service**
enters into production. Tests for the public API.

* **[SvcQC.Acc01]**

### Documentation [SvcQC.Doc]

* **[SvcQC.Doc01]** Documentation MUST be available online, easily
findable and accessible. [SQA-QC.Doc03].

* **[SvcQC.Doc02]** Documentation SHOULD have a Persistent Identifier (PID).

* **[SvcQC.Doc03]** Documentation MUST be version controlled. [SQA-QC.Doc01.1].

* **[SvcQC.Doc04]** Documentation MUST be updated on new **Service** versions
involving any change in the installation, configuration or behaviour of
the **Service**. [SQA-QC.Doc04].

* **[SvcQC.Doc05]** Documentation MUST be updated whenever reported
as inaccurate or unclear. [SQA-QC.Doc05].

* **[SvcQC.Doc06]** Documentation MUST have a non-software license.

* **[SvcQC.Doc07]** Documentation MUST be produced according to the
target audience, varying according to the **Service** specification.
The identified types of documentation and their RECOMMENDED content are:

  * **[SvcQC.Doc07.2]** Deployment and Administration. [SQA-QC.Doc06.3]:
    * Installation and configuration guides.
    * Service Reference Card, with the following RECOMMENDED content:
      * Brief functional description.
      * List of processes or daemons.
      * Init scripts and options.
      * List of configuration files, location and example or template.
      * Log files location and other useful audit information.
      * List of ports.
      * Service state information.
      * List of cron jobs.
      * Security information.
      * FAQs and troubleshooting.
  * **[SvcQC.Doc07.3]** User. [SQA-QC.Doc06.4]:
    * Detailed User Guide for the **Service**.
    * Public API documentation (if applicable).
    * Command-line (CLI) reference (if applicable).

### Policies [SvcQC.Pol]

* **[SvcQC.Pol01]** The **Service** MUST include the following policy documents:
  * **[SvcQC.Pol01.1]** Acceptable Usage Policy (AUP).
  * **[SvcQC.Pol01.2]** Access policy.
  * **[SvcQC.Pol01.3]** Privacy policy.

### Security [SvcQC.Sec]

* **[SvcQC.Sec01]** The **Service** public endpoints and APIs MUST be secured
with encryption.

* **[SvcQC.Sec02]** Dynamic application security testing (DAST)
[@url:https://www.techopedia.com/definition/30958/dynamic-application-security-testing-dast]
SHALL be performed from the outside, to the **Service** in an operation
state, to look for security vulnerabilities (e.g. SQL injection,
cross-site scripting, DDOS). [SQA-QC.Sec03].

* **[SvcQC.Sec03]** Manual penetration testing MAY be part of the
application security  verification effort. [SQA-QC.Sec04].

* **[SvcQC.Sec04]** The **Service** SHOULD have an Authentication mechanism.

* **[SvcQC.Sec05]** The **Service** MUST use strong ciphers for encryption.

* **[SvcQC.Sec06]** Credentials used in the **Service** MUST be signed by
a recognized certification authority.

* **[SvcQC.Sec07]** The **Service** MUST validate the credentials and signatures.

### Automated Deployment [SvcQC.Aud]

* **[SvcQC.Aud01]** Production-ready **Service** SHALL be deployed as
a workable system with the minimal user or system administrator interaction
leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools.

### Support [SvcQC.Sup]

* **[SvcQC.Sup01]** The **Service** MUST have a tracker or helpdesk
for operational and users issues.

* **[SvcQC.Sup02]** The **Service** SHOULD have a tracker for the
underlying software issues. [SQA-QC.Man01].

* **[SvcQC.Sup03]** The **Service** SHOULD include an Operational
Level Agreement (OLA) with the infrastructure where it is integrated.

* **[SvcQC.Sup04]** The **Service** MAY include Service Level
Agreement (SLA) with user communities.

### Monitoring, Alerts, Metrics [SvcQC.MAM]

* **[SvcQC.MAM01]** The **Service** in an operational production state SHOULD be monitored.
  * **[SvcQC.MAM01.1]** The **Service** public endpoints SHOULD be monitored.
  * **[SvcQC.MAM01.2]** The **Service** public APIs SHOULD be monitored.
  * **[SvcQC.MAM01.3]** The **Service** SHOULD for security related criteria (DAST).

* **[SvcQC.MAM02]** The **Service** SHOULD have alerts.

* **[SvcQC.MAM03]** The **Service** SHOULD have metrics.
