## Quality Criteria

The following sections describe the quality conventions and best
practices that apply to the development, operation and integration
phases of a **Service** with a production infrastructure for research,
such as the EOSC ecosystem. These guidelines rule the **Service** development
and operation process within the framework of the EOSC-Synergy project.

Some of the criteria in this document is similar or based on the
document "Software Quality Assurance baseline"
[@url:https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/160086], for such cases the
following tag is added to the criteria: [SQA-QC.XyNN] where QC.XyNN is
the codename of the criteria in that document.

### API Testing [SvcQC.Api]

Web services commonly use application programming interfaces (APIs) to expose
the available features to external consumers, which can be either oriented to 
the end-user or suitable for machine-to-machine communications.

An accurate implementation of a publicly-accessible API is driven by a clearly 
defined specification. The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) 
[@url:https://www.openapis.org/] provides the most suitable way to describe, 
compose, consume and validate APIs. The following requirements assume the 
presence of such an API specification.

* **[SvcQC.Api01]** API testing MUST cover the validation of the features
outlined in the specification (aka _contract testing_).
  * **[SvcQC.Api01.1]** Any change in the API not compliant with the OAS MUST 
  NOT pass contract testing.
  * **[SvcQC.Api01.2]** The use of OAS SHOULD narrow down the applicable set of
  test cases to the features described in the specification, avoiding unnecessary
  assertions.
  <!--
  * [Future Link to the SW baseline] OAS fosters test-driven development (TDD)
  as the de-facto scenario for API development: i) writing the specification,
  ii) writing tests, and iii) implementing the API endpoints
  -->

* **[SvcQC.Api02]** API testing SHOULD involve the use of test doubles, such
as mock servers or stubs, that act as a validation layer for the incoming 
requests.

### Integration Testing [SvcQC.Int]

Integration testing refers to the evaluation of the interactions among
coupled **Service** or parts of a system that cooperate to achieve a given
functionality.

* **[SvcQC.Int01]** Whenever a new functionality is involved, integration 
testing MUST guarantee the operation of any previously-working interaction 
with external **Services**. [SQA-QC.Int01]
  * When using APIs, contract testing MUST detect any disruption in the
  communication between provider and consumer endpoints, through the validation
  of the API specification [SvcQC.Api01]

* **[SvcQC.Int02]** Integration testing SHOULD be automated.

* **[SvcQC.Int03]** Ad-hoc pilot **Service** infrastructures and/or local
testbeds MAY be used to cope with the integration testing requirements. [SQA-QC.Int04].

### Functional tests [SvcQC.Fun]
Functional testing is a type of black-box testing. It involves the verification
of the **Service** identified functionality, based on requested requirements and
agreed design specifications. This type of **Service** testing focus on the evaluation
of the functionality that the **Service** exposes, leaving apart any internal
design analysis or side-effects to external systems.

* **[SvcQC.Fun01]** Functional testing SHOULD tend to cover the full scope 
--e.g. positive, negative, edge cases-- for the set of functionality that the
**Service** claims to provide. [SQA-QC.Fun01].
  * **[SvcQC.Fun01.1]** Functional tests MUST include the public APIs of the
  **Service**. When using APIs, contract testing MUST detect any disruption in
  the features exposed by the provider to the consumer, through the validation
  of the API specification. [SvcQC.Api01]
  * **[SvcQC.Fun01.2]** Functional tests SHOULD include the Web interface of
  the **Service**.

* **[SvcQC.Fun02]** Functional tests SHOULD be checked automatically.

* **[SvcQC.Fun03]** Functional tests SHOULD be provided by the developers of the underlying
  software. [SQA-QC.Fun04].

### Performace tests [SvcQC.Per]

Performance testing verifies that the software meets the specified performance
requirements and assesses performance characteristics - for instance,
capacity and response time [@url:http://www.swebok.org].

Stress or Load testing, exercises software at the maximum design load, as well as beyond it,
with the goal of determining the behavioral limits, and to test defense
mechanisms in critical systems [@url:http://www.swebok.org]. *Stress testing is
a subset of Performance testing*
[@url:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-performance-and-stress-testing/].

Scalability testing is test methodology in which an application’s or **Service**
performance is measured in terms of its ability to scale up *and/or* scale out the
number of user requests or other such performance measure attributes, through
an increase in the amount of available resources. The definition
is based on [@url:https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2737182.2737185].
*Scalability testing is a subset of Performance testing*.

Elasticity testing is adequate to **Services** in cloud resources or infrastructures.
Elasticity is based on how quickly a **Services** in a cloud environment is able to
adapt [@url:https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2737182.2737185], in response
to variable demand or workload for the software service [@doi:10.1186/s13677-019-0134-y].
*Elasticity testing is a subset of Performance testing*.

* **[SvcQC.Per01]** Performance testing SHOULD be carried out to check the
  **Service** performance under varying loads.

* **[SvcQC.Per02]** Stress testing SHOULD be carried out to check the
  **Service** to determine the behavioral limits under sudden increased load.

* **[SvcQC.Per03]** Scalability testing MAY be carried out to check the
  **Service** hability to scale up *and/or* scale out when its load reach the limits.

* **[SvcQC.Per04]** Elasticity testing MAY be carried out to check the
  **Service** hability to scale out or scale in, depending on its demand or workload.

### Policies [SvcQC.Pol]

* **[SvcQC.Pol01]** The **Service** MUST include the following policy documents:
  * **[SvcQC.Pol01.1]** Acceptable Usage Policy (AUP): An acceptable use policy (AUP),
  acceptable usage policy or fair use policy, is a set of rules applied by the owner, creator or 
  administrator of a network, website, or service, that restrict the ways in which the network, 
  website or system may be used and sets guidelines as to how it should be used. 
  * **[SvcQC.Pol01.2]** Access Policy or Terms of Use: represent a binding legal
  contract between the users (and/or costumers), and the Provider of the **Service**.
  The Access Policy, mandate the users (and/or costumers) access to and the use of
  Provider’s **Service**.
  * **[SvcQC.Pol01.3]** Privacy Policy: Data privacy statement informing the users

service from where tests are executed or sent and results of those tests are shown.
The tests can be the same, in part or in total of the Functional tests.
The technology used for the monitoring, is left to the developers of the underlying
software to decide eventually with input from the infrastructure(s),
