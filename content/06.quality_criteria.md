## Quality Criteria

The following sections describe the quality conventions and best
practices that apply to the development, operation and integration
phases of a **Service** with a production infrastructure for research,
such as the EOSC ecosystem. These guidelines rule the **Service** development
and operation process within the framework of the EOSC-Synergy project.

Some of the criteria in this document is similar or based on the
document "Software Quality Assurance baseline"
[@url:https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/160086], for such cases the
following tag is added to the criteria: [SQA-QC.XyNN] where QC.XyNN is
the codename of the criteria in that document.

### Integration Testing [SvcQC.Int]

Integration testing refers to the evaluation of the interactions among
coupled **Service** or parts of a system that cooperate to achieve a given
functionality.

* **[SvcQC.Int01]** Integration testing outcome MUST guarantee the overall
operation of the  **Service** whenever new functionality is involved. [SQA-QC.Int01].

* **[SvcQC.Int02]** Integration testing SHOULD be automated.

* **[SvcQC.Int03]** Ad-hoc pilot **Service** infrastructures and/or local
testbeds MAY be used to cope with the integration testing requirements. [SQA-QC.Int04].

### Functional tests [SvcQC.Fun]
Functional testing is a type of black-box testing. It involves the verification
of the **Service** identified functionality, based on requested requirements and
agreed design specifications. This type of **Service** testing focus on the evaluation
of the functionality that the **Service** exposes, leaving apart any internal
design analysis or side-effects to external systems.

* **[SvcQC.Fun01]** Functional testing SHOULD tend to cover the full set of functionality that
  the **Service** claims to provide. [SQA-QC.Fun01].
  * **[SvcQC.Fun01.1]** Functional tests SHOULD be checked automatically.
  * **[SvcQC.Fun01.2]** Functional tests SHOULD include the public APIs of the **Service**.
  * **[SvcQC.Fun01.3]** Functional tests SHOULD include the Web interface of the **Service**.

* **[SvcQC.Fun04]** Functional tests SHOULD be provided by the developers of the inderlying
  software. [SQA-QC.Fun04].

### Performace tests [SvcQC.Per]

Performance testing verifies that the software meets the specified performance
requirements and assesses performance characteristics - for instance,
capacity and response time [@url:http://www.swebok.org].

Stress or Load testing, exercises software at the maximum design load, as well as beyond it,
with the goal of determining the behavioral limits, and to test defense
mechanisms in critical systems [@url:http://www.swebok.org]. *Stress testing is
a subset of Performance testing*
[@url:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-performance-and-stress-testing/].

Scalability testing is test methodology in which an application’s or **Service**
performance is measured in terms of its ability to scale up *and/or* scale out the
number of user requests or other such performance measure attributes, through
an increase in the amount of available resources. The definition
is based on [@url:https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2737182.2737185].
*Scalability testing is a subset of Performance testing*.

Elasticity testing is adequate to **Services** in cloud resources or infrastructures.
Elasticity is based on how quickly a **Services** in a cloud environment is able to
adapt [@url:https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2737182.2737185], in response
to variable demand or workload for the software service [@doi:10.1186/s13677-019-0134-y].
*Elasticity testing is a subset of Performance testing*.

* **[SvcQC.Per01]** Performance testing SHOULD be carried out to check the
  **Service** performance under varying loads.

* **[SvcQC.Per02]** Stress testing SHOULD be carried out to check the
  **Service** to determine the behavioral limits under sudden increased load.

* **[SvcQC.Per03]** Scalability testing MAY be carried out to check the
  **Service** hability to scale up *and/or* scale out when its load reach the limits.

* **[SvcQC.Per04]** Elasticity testing MAY be carried out to check the
  **Service** hability to scale out or scale in, depending on its demand or workload.

### Documentation [SvcQC.Doc]

* **[SvcQC.Doc01]** Documentation MUST be available online, easily
findable and accessible. [SQA-QC.Doc03].

* **[SvcQC.Doc02]** Documentation SHOULD have a Persistent Identifier (PID).

* **[SvcQC.Doc03]** Documentation MUST be version controlled. [SQA-QC.Doc01.1].

* **[SvcQC.Doc04]** Documentation MUST be updated on new **Service** versions
involving any change in the installation, configuration or behaviour of
the **Service**. [SQA-QC.Doc04].

as inaccurate or unclear. [SQA-QC.Doc05].

* **[SvcQC.Doc06]** Documentation MUST have a non-software license.
