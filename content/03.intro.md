## Introduction

The Open Science realization in Europe is already taking its first steps by
means of the implementation of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). The
EOSC aims at providing researchers with a unique, federated and inclusive
view of fit-for-purpose services, developed and operated by the diverse European
research infrastructures, including the underlying e-Infrastructures. Consequently,
the ultimate success of the EOSC heavily relies on the quality aspects of those
services, such as their stability or functional suitability.

The meaning of **Service** can be regarded from different perspectives.
From an IT Service Management (ITSM) standpoint, such as the EOSC Service Management
System (SMS) process model, a service is devised as a means to "provide value
to the customer". The same goal is shared by the DevOps paradigm, but in this
case there is a more pragmatic vision that the customer satisfaction is achieved
through the continuous delivery of quality-assured services, with a shorter
life cycle, as the final outcome of a comprehensive software development process.

The ITSM model has a broader focus. A service is an "intangible asset" that
also includes additional activities such as customer engagement and support.
Consequently, it is a much heavier process that might not be appropriate to
be applicable for all types of services. The DevOps model, on the other hand,
narrows down the scope to meet the user expectations by acting exclusively on
the quality features of the service, which is seen as an aggregate of software
components in operation.

## Purpose

This document provides an initial approach to Service Quality Assurance,
meant to be applied in the integration process of the services existing
under the EOSC-Synergy project, which eventually will be accessible as part
of the EOSC offerings.

The criteria compiled in this document favours a pragmatic and systematic
approach that puts emphasis on the programmatic assessment of the quality
conventions. To this end, the criteria herein compiled builds on the DevOps
culture already established in the preceding Software Quality Assurance baseline
document [@url:https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/160086] to outline the set
of good practices that seek the usability and
reliability of services, and meet the user expectations in terms of functional
requirements.

## Contextualization of a Service

As a result, a **Service**, as conceived in this document, represents the following:

* **Web service** [WS] [@url:https://techterms.com/definition/web_service]:
    * A web service is an application or data source that is accessible via
    a standard web protocol (HTTP or HTTPS).
    * Web services are designed to communicate with other programs,
    rather than directly with users.
    * Most web services provide an API, or a set of functions and commands,
    that can be used to access the data.

* **Web application** [WApp] [@url:https://techterms.com/definition/web_application]:
    * A web application or "web app" is a software program that is delivered over
    the Internet and is accessed through a web browser.

* **Platform** or **Service Composition** [Plat]
[@url:https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/Service_Composition]:
    * Aggregation of multiple small services into larger services.
    * An integrated set of Web services, Web applications and software components.

Examples are: Web portals, Scientific portals and gateways, data repositories.
