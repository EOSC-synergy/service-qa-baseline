    "abstract": "Context: In cloud computing, there is a multitude of definitions and metrics for scalability, elasticity, and efficiency. However, stakeholders have little guidance for choosing fitting definitions and metrics for these quality properties, thus leading to potential misunderstandings. For example, cloud consumers and providers cannot negotiate reliable and quantitative service level objectives directly understood by each stakeholder. Objectives: Therefore, we examine existing definitions and metrics for these quality properties from the viewpoint of cloud consumers, cloud providers, and software architects with regard to commonly used concepts. Methods: We execute a systematic literature review (SLR), reproducibly collecting common concepts in definitions and metrics for scalability, elasticity, and efficiency. As quality selection criteria, we assess whether existing literature differentiates the three properties, exemplifies metrics, and considers typical cloud characteristics and cloud roles. Results: Our SLR yields 418 initial results from which we select 20 for in-depth evaluation based on our quality selection criteria. In our evaluation, we recommend concepts, definitions, and metrics for each property. Conclusions: Software architects can use our recommendations to analyze the quality of cloud computing applications. Cloud providers and cloud consumers can specify service level objectives based on our metric suggestions.",
